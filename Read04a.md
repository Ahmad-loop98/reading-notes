Javascript is language used to add to html and css , in this language you should deal with operators and expressions which have many divided mainly into unary, binary opeartors and a conditional opeartors .
binary operators have one operand before the operator and another after as we will see .
| Unary       |Binary  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|     x++     |  3+4     |
| ++x         |   x*y  |

opeartors can be also assignment which assigns value to its left side and any arithmetic symbol can be used here such like : x*=y which is a shorthand operator .
