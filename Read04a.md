Javascript is language used to add to html and css , in this language you should deal with operators and expressions which have many divided mainly into unary, binary opeartors and a conditional opeartors .
binary operators have one operand before the operator and another after as we will see .

| Unary       |Binary  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|     x++     |  3+4     |
| ++x         |   x*y  |


opeartors can be also assignment which assigns value to its left side and any arithmetic symbol can be used here such like : x*=y which is a shorthand operator .
JS has to return a value using this operators but it follows an order so logical assignments returns the logical opeartion without assignment .
> Note that the return values are always based on the operandsâ€™ values before the operation .
_destructing_ extracting values from arrays or objects using a syntax reflecting the same as array and objects defined.

Comparison opeartors which follow rules and you have to have some logical concepts to deal with logical opeartors between other operands and what would be the output .
JS has keywords if you use it then your webpage would interact with users that mainly as user opens page then js shows him pop up box to put some fields or to show content .

## logical opeartors 
AND
: if one side is false then result false .
OR 
: if one opearnd is true then result is true .
Not 
: the opposite of opearnd if false then true and vise versa .
## some JS keywords .
- [alert]
- [console log]
- [if] .

_* and other words _* .

 # Concatination
 JS script has concept for string exprssions if you use (+) then JS render your string as a one expression .
 # Ternary opeartors .
 it returns true or false based on your case as this code :

 var status = (age >= 18) ? 'adult' : 'minor';
 * returns true if you are adult otherwies returns false .
 # void .
 a keyword that doesn't return any value .
 # Precedence .
 important concept in JS that deals with opearnds then returns a value based on it .

 ** if you want to override expression and evalutes it first you should use parentheses and evalutes the result rgardless the order of Precedence ** .
 # Expressions .
 |  exp    |its used |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|    this     |  calling obj in amethod     |
|  super        |   calling object's father  |
|     new          |               making new instance object             |

 # A Control flow 
 an overview of your code structure usually code runs sequntialy from first line unless you have loops and conditions .
