## Loops
its a programming concept like conditional statements but here it resolves a huge problem consuming so much time and effort for programmers which is if you wanted to repeat something 1000 times for example a for loop or which statement will cut your road .

## FOR Loop 
if i wanted to repeat anumber 10 times here is a for loop to repeat it .

**for(var i=1;i<10;i++)**

it is as shown divided into 3 parts .

1.declartion .

2.condition that you provide .

3.updated data where whatever you want to increment or decrement the value that will be evaluted .

and then of course you need to print your output so you want a console.log .
## While Loop
it only takes a condition and as well as your condition is true it will execute the loop.

**Notice that your condition in aloop statement must reach a point and after this point it should terminates to false otherwise your loop will be executed forever **
