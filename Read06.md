# Functions
a code inside barckets executes when calling them it is used for performing something .
# Syntax 
you can name your function anything you want but make sure it is related to the code you can make it anonymus but good practice is to name it that you will write then a code then by parentheses you declare parameters then you open brackets and write your code inside you can declare variables , use if or loops to evalute output .

# Notes about functions .
1.it is important to call a function outside brackets so that it executes that function otherwise it will be undefined .

2.function scope : if you declare a variable inside function it's called local variable and it is not accessed outside a function brackets .

3.if you wanted to call a function more than once then you should make your function a recursive as loops but helps instead of calling many times in many lines  here,by one line your function will be repeated .

4.you can define nested function in your code an inner and an outer as : funcAdd , funcSquare the outer accesses the lines of out the inner and inner accesses varaiables
and expressions inside it .
# why using it .
in order to organize your code splitting it into tasks making it more easy to perform a task once not conflicting other tasks or actions in code .
